Hmm.. Input parameters.. Dunno.. There is a resource file inside a Zip, also you can freely add images and other code to it.. Also don't forget to read the read please.txt file for some explanations..

This code also saves your-made maps in format .mpd

which is really easy to decode.. Try it, but don't go very far. It's really simple! :)

Hmm.. There is a side Effect on my computer, when I use Alt-Tab.. It says Automation Error.
